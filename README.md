This repository contains the official implementation of **GeoDiff-SAR**, a diffusion model framework for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image generation. The implementation is based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 (SD3.5) with LoRA fine-tuning, achieving high-quality SAR image generation through **tri-modal feature fusion** (text, 3D point cloud, and image features).

## 📋 Overview

GeoDiff-SAR is a novel approach to SAR image generation that leverages geometric priors from 3D models. This implementation **directly uses pre-extracted 3D model features** without requiring scattering calculations, simplifying the feature extraction pipeline. By fusing text descriptions, 3D geometric features, and image features, we achieve high-fidelity SAR image generation.

The overall architecture of the proposed GeoDiff-SAR framework is shown below. (a) Construction of Geometric Priors: 3D models are processed via a point cloud processing module to extract explicit geometric scattering characteristics, such as multi-bounce reflections, serving as a robust physical prior. (b) Multi-modal Fusion Network: These physical features are synthesized with textual and visual conditions through a multi-modal fusion network to condition the Stable Diffusion 3.5 backbone, which is efficiently adapted to the SAR domain using LoRA (trainable) while keeping the pre-trained weights
frozen. (c) Controllable Generative Model: As depicted in the top-right, the generated high-fidelity SAR images are utilized to augment scarce real training data for downstream PyTorch Image Models Multi-Label Classification tasks, thereby validating the practical utility and effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation strategy.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for acceleration)
- At least 24GB GPU memory (for training)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd for_github
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For CUDA support, install PyTorch with CUDA:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### Step 1: Download Model Weights

Download the following model weights and place them in the corresponding directories:

```
Stable-diffusion/SD3/
  └── sd3.5_medium.safetensors

clip/
  ├── clip_l.safetensors
  ├── clip_g.safetensors
  └── t5xxl_fp16.safetensors
```

**Download links**:
- SD3.5 Medium: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium)
- CLIP-L/G: Included in SD3.5 model files
- T5-XXL: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-v1_1-xxl)

See the `README.md` files in each directory for detailed download instructions.

### Step 2: Prepare 3D Point Cloud Features

Place your pre-extracted 3D point cloud feature files in the `3d_features/` directory:

- **Format**: `.pt` or `.npy` files
- **Naming**: `<sample_id>.pt` (e.g., `1.pt`, `2.pt`)
- **Content**: Each file should contain a 3D model feature vector (dimension: 64)

> **Note**: This implementation directly uses pre-extracted 3D features without scattering calculations. Feature files should contain geometric features extracted from 3D models.

### Step 3: Training

```powershell
./train_sd35m_24GLora.ps1

## 🔬 Tri-Modal Feature Fusion

### Fusion Architecture

Our implementation fuses features from three modalities:

1. **Text Features**: Extracted via CLIP-L, CLIP-G, and T5-XXL encoders
2. **3D Point Cloud Features**: Directly uses pre-extracted 3D model features (no scattering computation required)
3. **Image Features**: Features extracted from image latent space

### Supported Fusion Methods

| Method | Description | Characteristics |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `concat` | Concatenation fusion | Simple and direct, concatenates three features then projects |
| `add` | Addition fusion | Requires all modalities to have the same dimension |
| `attention` | Attention fusion | Uses multi-head attention to learn inter-modal relationships |
| `gentle` | Gentle fusion | Primarily preserves text features, lightly incorporates 3D information |
| `gated` | Gated fusion | Adaptively learns when to use 3D information |
| `attention_gated` | Attention-gated fusion | Combines attention and gating mechanisms |
| `image_guided` | Image-guided fusion | Pushes toward image semantics while maintaining fidelity |
| `hybrid_film_attn` | Hybrid FiLM+Attention fusion ⭐ | **Recommended method**, combines FiLM modulation and attention |

### Recommended Fusion Method

We recommend using `hybrid_film_attn`, which achieves high-quality fusion through:

1. **Multi-modal Gating**: Uses softmax weights to adaptively balance three modalities
2. **FiLM Modulation**: Generates per-channel gamma and beta based on fused features and image features
3. **Attention Refinement**: Further refines features through self-attention mechanism
4. **Image Semantic Push**: Pushes toward image semantics while maintaining generation fidelity

## 🔍 Technical Details

### 3D Feature Processing

This implementation **directly uses pre-extracted 3D model features** without scattering calculations. The feature processing pipeline:

1. **Feature Loading**: Loads 3D features from `.pt` or `.npy` files
2. **Feature Projection**: Projects 3D features to text feature dimension (768-dim) via linear layers
3. **Position Encoding**: Adds position encoding to distinguish different points
4. **Attention Processing**: Processes point cloud sequences using multi-head self-attention
5. **Global Pooling**: Obtains fixed-dimension feature vectors via global average pooling

### Image Feature Processing

Image features are extracted from latent space:

1. **Feature Loading**: Loads image latent features from `.npz` files
2. **Convolutional Processing**: Extracts spatial features via convolutional layers
3. **Global Pooling**: Extracts global image features
4. **Feature Projection**: Projects to the same dimension as text features

### Fusion Pipeline

The overall tri-modal fusion pipeline:

```
Text Features (CLIP-L/G + T5-XXL)
    ↓
3D Point Cloud Features (pre-extracted) ──→ [Feature Projection] ──→ [Fusion Module] ──→ Fused Features ──→ SD3.5 UNet
    ↓
Image Features (Latent Space) ──→ [Feature Projection] ──→
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **3D Feature Format**: 
   - This implementation directly uses pre-extracted 3D model features without scattering calculations
   - Feature files should be in `.pt` or `.npy` format
   - Feature dimension should match the `pointcloud_dim` parameter (default: 64)

2. **Path Configuration**: 
   - All paths are relative paths; ensure running from the `for_github` directory
   - Training and inference scripts automatically locate related files

3. **Model Weights**: 
   - All required weight files must be downloaded to run
   - Recommended to run `python check_weights.py` to verify file integrity

4. **Dataset**: 
   - Currently includes 10 samples for demonstration
   - More data is needed for actual training to achieve better results

## 🐛 Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Training fails with "3D feature file not found"**  
A: Ensure that corresponding `.pt` or `.npy` files exist in the `3d_features/` directory, and filenames match dataset sample IDs (e.g., `1.pt`).

**Q: How to change the fusion method?**  
A: Modify the `$fusion_method` parameter in the training script, or use the `--fusion_method` argument during inference.

**Q: How to disable 3D fusion during inference?**  
A: Simply remove the `--enable_3d_fusion` argument; the model will use only text and image features.

**Q: How to adjust fusion strength?**  
A: Control fusion strength via the `FUSION_INJECTION_SCALE` environment variable (0.0-1.0, default: 1.0).
